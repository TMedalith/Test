# Connected Paths

This is a web application developed in Python using the Flask framework. The application generates and processes matrices to represent graphs and finds the connected paths between the nodes of the graph.

## Features

- Random generation of a matrix to represent a graph.
- Setting ones on the main diagonal to ensure paths from a node to itself.
- Calculation of connected paths between the nodes of the graph.
- Visualization of the generated and processed matrices on the web interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- NumPy
